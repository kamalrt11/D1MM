              <p>His plans were to greatly reduce the cost of access to space, and also to greatly improve the reliability of such access. He wished every person could travel into space. He wanted to build low-cost space commercial vehicles. Therefore he
                invested 70% of his income in a company named SpaceX. But his initial three rockets exploded within the earth's atmosphere. In an interview, he was told Americans don't believe in his ideas He should stop working on his ideas. At that
                time there were tears in his eyes and He said I will never give up. That time he had only that much amount of money left that he can launch his last rocket. If it also fails, he will become bankrupt but he believed in his ideas, Finally,
                the 4th rocket went a huge success and NASA offered him 1.6 Billion investment.<br>
